# Show Alert Window

Show Alert Window is a custom MetaTrader script that opens the system Alerts window of the MetaTrader platform. It was coded by EarnForex.com for MT4 and MT5.

Its main purpose is to provide a quick and easy way to see alerts if a trader has already closed the alert window for some reason.
